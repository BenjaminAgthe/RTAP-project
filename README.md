SOFA - Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics
==============================================

SOFA is a file format for reading, saving, and describing spatially
oriented data of acoustic systems.

Examples of data we consider are head-related transfer functions (HRTFs),
binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs), multichannel measurements such as done
with microphone arrays, or directionality data of loudspeakers.

The format specifications are the major issue, but we also aim in providing APIs
for reading and writing the data in SOFA.

For more information on the format specifications and available data have a look
