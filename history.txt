*** DEVELOPMENT STATUS ***

*** v0.1.1 (16.4.2013) by Piotr Majdak
- SOFAload improved: checks added. Still further checks would be nice, but it can be used now.
- SOFAsave improved: saves user-defined variables
- SOFAexpand added: expands the singleton dimensions in the SOFA object
- Convertors for MIT KEMAR, LISTEN, and CIPIC databases added (with corresponding demos)
- HRTF directory created where all HRTFs should be stored. The convertors rely on that.
- SOFAspat improved, now the engine works better

*** v0.1.0 (11.4.2013) by Piotr Majdak
- Saving/Loading works in Matlab, it is quite rudimentary now:
  - Data and Variables saved as Double
  - No string in variables supported yet
  - One Conventions implemented and tested (SingleFreeFieldHRIR)
  - Loading: no checks (todo)
  - Saving: removes optional variables (bug)
  - No partial loading/saving yet 
- Convertion: ARI2SOFA with demo_ARI2SOFA added
- Spatialization: very rudimentary demo added (SOFAspat and demo_SOFAspat), just for fun

*** v0.0.12 (12.3.2013) by Piotr Majdak
- Conventions: transmitter renamed to emitter

*** v0.0.11 (7.3.2013) by Piotr Majdak
- Conventions added
- Octave branch deleted
- Examples: ARI2SOFA as a function
- General: adapted to current specs. Don't use yet.

*** v0.0.10 (5.3.2013) by Piotr Majdak
- ARI2SOFA: changed to a function now, the fields are more clear defined
- SOFAsave: transmitted and receiver separated, dimensions changed
- Specs are being drastically changed - beware of using this version at the current development state

*** v0.0.9 (31.1.2013) by Piotr Majdak
- included octave part from Hagen Wierstorf
- changed the data structure format
- added try-catch to SOFAsave to avoid open file handles

*** v0.0.8 (24.08.2012) by Wolfgang Hrauda
- changed data structure format
- updates and fixes in several functions and scripts
- added Eigenmike.sofa as a demo file

*** v0.0.7 (23.08.2012) by Wolfgang Hrauda
- now using structures or cells as input and output values of functions
- added and renamed several functions and scripts
- updates in several functions and scripts

*** v0.0.6 (14.08.2012) by Wolfgang Hrauda
- added new functions for coordinate type conversion
- functionality of SOFAgetData slightly expanded
- dismissed function SOFAloadVariables (is now an option in SOFAload)
- "ARI_to_SOFA_lab_setup" updated
- minor fixes in several functions

*** v0.0.5 (08.08.2012) by Wolfgang Hrauda
- implemented additional dimensions for string variables in SOFAsave
- added new function SOFAloadVariables (a variant of SOFAload)
- added new demo script "ARI_to_SOFA_lab_setup"
- fixes in several functions

*** v0.0.4 (07.08.2012) by Wolfgang Hrauda
- fixed some issues in SOFAsave
- minor changes in SOFAload
- added new functions SOFAgetID, SOFAgetData, SOFAlistVariables

*** v0.0.3 (03.08.2012) by Wolfgang Hrauda
- split demo script in two API functions and one script that calls them
- change file extension to 'sofa'

*** v0.0.2 (01.08.2012) by Wolfgang Hrauda
- finished matrix dimension check

*** v0.0.1 (31.07.2012) by Wolfgang Hrauda
- demo script that loads ARI .mat file, converts it to SOFA format and writes to .nc-file
  then reads all data from .nc.file
