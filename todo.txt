* the handling of the data matrix is not ideal at the moment. The struct
  construct could be annoying when you want to easily get your data into the
  SOFA file. That should be changed. *** Changed to Data.XXX(M,R,N)

* if the SOFAsave functions ends with an error, it stops without closing the
  ncid, which is not a good practice and can mean you have to close Matlab,
  before you can again working on the NC file.  *** try-catch added

* the handling of the arguments to the SOFAsave function is not ideal. it would
  be better to have 
  SOFAsave(Filename,'Data',data,'DataType','FIR')
  instead of
  SOFAsave(Filename,{{'Data',data},{'DataType','FIR'}})
  *** We use structures now

* SOFAloadMetadata: the reading as struct metadata is not workin at the moment

* check if the data is stored as radians or degree

* the SOFAparse function is not working probably at the moment. I was only able
  to find the ID for an angle of 0Â°

* the filename is always handled with [Filename '.sofa'], that is not a good
  behavior, I will change it to just Filename. *** Agreed.


===== Per file suggestions ===============================================
NETCDFsave:
* currently a string, or a string matrix is converted to a cellstr first and the
  dimensions of the cell is checked. It is supposed, that the dimension of the
  cell could be MxN. But this is not possible in my opinion. cellstr works only
  for a matrix (not a(1,2,3)), and therefore the size off the cell is always
  Mx1, which makes the whole conversion to the cell useless.
